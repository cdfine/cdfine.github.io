      I’ve been fortunate to have received guidance from Carli for several years. 
      Carli takes an “above and beyond” approach to all facets of her work and is, without a doubt, 
      one of the most hardworking and intelligent researchers I’ve ever met. 
      Apart from being an excellent scientist, she has deep knowledge about navigating careers in research, 
      from graduate school admissions to paths within and outside academia. Carli is deeply passionate about 
      supporting young scientists: she has worked with several organizations to break down barriers to academic 
      careers and is very involved in the broader community. She approaches career decisions with thoughtfulness, 
      emotional intelligence, compassion, and a wealth of insights and relevant resources. I would highly recommend 
      her to anyone seeking career guidance, whether you’re applying to programs or positioning yourself for a new role.

    <div class="testimonial-card">
      Carli was extremely helpful, especially with my statement. Not only was she a wealth of knowledge in her own right, 
      she provided me with so many resources that were beneficial in being able to see how I should structure my statement, 
      what to include, and what to leave out. Beyond this though, Carli met with me regularly (and allowed me to record our 
      conversations so I could utilize them at a later date) to discuss the paper and edit it to its best version. Most importantly, 
      I think Carli is a very kind person who wanted me to succeed and was excited for me when I did.

    <div class="testimonial-card">
      I cannot recommend Carli enough as a mentor figure! She has a thorough understanding of how to navigate larger systems 
      of academia and professional life that can feel like a secret language to many. Carli will walk you through exactly how 
      to reach your goals with an encouraging and passionate attitude! She has personally supported me through successful 
      graduate school applications and career transitions, all with a systems-level and neurodivergent-friendly lens. If you 
      need support from someone with the knowledge, skills, and tools to help you succeed who will also genuinely lift you up 
      as a person, Carli is the coach for you!
