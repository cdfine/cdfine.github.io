  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <p><i>"I’ve been fortunate to have received guidance from Carli for several years. Carli takes an “above and beyond” approach to all facets of her work and is, without a doubt, one of the most hardworking and intelligent researchers I’ve ever met. Apart from being an excellent scientist, she has deep knowledge about navigating careers in research, from graduate school admissions to paths within and outside academia. Carli is deeply passionate about supporting young scientists: she has worked with several organizations to break down barriers to academic careers and is very involved in the broader community. She approaches career decisions with thoughtfulness, emotional intelligence, compassion, and a wealth of insights and relevant resources. I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking career guidance, whether you’re applying to programs or positioning yourself for a new role."</i>-I.F. (mentee)</p>
