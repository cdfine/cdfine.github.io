	<h1>Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion</h1>
	<h2>DEI Philosophy</h2>
	<p>My interest in individual differences in perceptual processing is rooted in the recognition of human diversity and the desire to help people gain insights into their roles in the world. As a result, I am equally as passionate about mentorship and transformational teaching as I am about scientific rigor. In my DEI work, I am guided by the following two principles: </p>
    	<ul>
		<li>Building Community
		<li>Breaking Down Content Knowledge Barriers
	</ul>
