	<h1>Teaching & Mentorship</h1>
	<h2>Teaching Philosophy </h2>
	<p>My interest in individual differences in perceptual processing is rooted in the recognition of human diversity and the desire to help people gain insights into their roles in the world. As a result, I am equally as passionate about mentorship and transformational teaching as I am about scientific rigor. As a teacher and peer mentor, I am guided by the following three principles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="larger-font">Enthusiasm: I aim to inspire students/mentees to pursue their goals, and feel encouraged about their potential for advancement.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Balance critique with affirmations
			<li>Instill moments of joy into our work 
			<li>Express gratitude for others' contributions
		</ul>
		<li class="larger-font">Compassion: I aim to treat students/mentees as whole people, not only from the shoulders up, acknowledging that students/mentees are whole people who enter with their own background experiences, biases, and needs that may differ from my own.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Be welcoming and inclusive of mentees from any background
			<li>Be non-judgemental of new ideas
			<li>Encourage a growth mindset
		</ul>
		<li class="larger-font">Content Knowledge: I aim to be open and transparent with the knowledge that I have, and seek resources to help my students/mentees achieve their goals.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Offer informed critique and skill-building resources
			<li>Demonstrate transparency about the aims and processes of our projects
			<li>Serve as a connection point for my professional network 
		</ul>
	</ul>
